# BIGINT c++
<p>
This function is used to make operations with c++ easier using big integers and it performs operations such as adding,subtracting , multiplication,square root, factorial, fibonacci series etc on big integers.
  In C++, a big integer (BigInt) typically refers to a class or implementation that allows handling of very large integers that exceed the limits of primitive data types like int, long, or even long long. The BigInt class can store integers of arbitrary size, much like the BigInteger class in Java or Python's built-in arbitrary precision integers.

Since C++ does not have a built-in BigInt type, such functionality can be achieved by creating a custom class or by using third-party libraries like GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library) or Boost.Multiprecision.
